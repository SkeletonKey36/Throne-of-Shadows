	Im thinking the vibe is maybe that these were bustling towns however the new warlord taking over made the towns isolate. In the last 2 years communication and travel between city to city has decreased significantly as no one is protecting the roads anymore and it’s confusing as if they want to declare independence or if they side with the new king, old king, or don’t want anything to do with it

    I want the capitol a little fleshed out. The city the party becomes immortality investigators fleshed out. And then some smaller towns and maybe one more big city
    
    One thing I thought would be cool is if since the warlord took control via divination and future telling/visions and since those visions are now predicting his death, he tried to kill all his fortune tellers and employed a particular creature that smells divination magic and will seek to kill its source.
	So if there are times the seer with them wants to predict the future then they must fight off the creatures that show up to kill her
